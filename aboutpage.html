          In 2023 Laura Fergusson Brain Injury Trust was successful in securing
          a 12-month Lotteries Grant fund to set up a Traumatic Brain Injury
          Peer & WhƒÅnau Support Service. Laura Fergusson Brain Injury Trust has
          been providing rehabilitation and residential support for people with
          traumatic brain Injury (TBI) from concussion through to severe,
          long-term injury for many years.

        <p>
          A common theme amongst those with TBI and their support people is the
          feeling of being misunderstood, isolated, frustrated with the slow
          progress and alone in their recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          The complex journey of rehabilitation and recovery is hard to navigate
          for families and those with the injury, having support from someone
          who has been through it can be invaluable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traumatic Brain Injury is often an invisible injury and therefore is
          even harder to understand for those around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim is to have a large database of keen volunteers of different
          ages, from all different walks of life and locations in the Canterbury
          region. We want to be able to offer support to those who would like to
          talk to someone who can truly understand what they are struggling
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          The support may be a simple phone call or text, it could be a coffee
          and a walk. It may be once a week or just as required.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to find a good fit for everyone, so that practical experiences
          can be shared and emotional support can be provided.

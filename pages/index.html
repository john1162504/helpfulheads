          <h2>Peer Support</h2>
          <p>
            A free Traumatic Brain Injury Peer Support Service for people with
            TBI (concussion/moderate/severe) and those that support them.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Peer Support?</h2>
          <p>
            Peer Support is when people use their own experiences to help each
            other, sharing knowledge or providing emotional support, social
            interaction or practical help. People with a brain injury (incl.
            concussion) and their support networks can feel very isolated and
            misunderstood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Helpful Heads has a number of volunteers who have lived experience
            of brain injury (either with an injury themselves, or through
            supporting someone who does) who would love to help others going
            through a similar experience. Thereâ€™s nothing quite like talking
            with someone who understands what you are going through.
